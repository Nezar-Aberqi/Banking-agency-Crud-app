### Banking Agency Project --Nezar Aberqi

Hello fellow coders!!
This is my first java app ^_^
I used the javafx framework, java and MYSQL for the database part.
The user's interface was built using Scene Builder , fxml files were created afterwards , and class controllers as well.
This app will allow the Bank agency admin to create or delete bank accounts for his clients, it also provides the clients with the service of depositing and/or withdrawing 
their money in/from their bank accounts. 
Many critic cases were handled as well.
Happy Coding 👩🏻‍💻.
